If current policies remain unchanged, fewer than one-quarter of the 450 million new jobs needed in Africa in the next 20 years will be created. These are among the key findings of the Africa Competitiveness Report 2017, a biennial publication jointly produced by the World Economic Forum, the African Development Bank, and the World Bank Group. Priorities to meet the changing demographics include policy reform to improve the quality of institutions, infrastructure, skills and adoption of new technology. House construction and better urban planning present opportunities for short-term competitiveness gains. The report finds that the ability of Africa's economies to generate enough jobs for its young and growing population rests on the successful implementation of urgent structural reforms to boost productivity. Competitiveness is defined as the set of institutions, policies and factors that determine the level of productivity, and hence future prosperity, of a country. The report, which covers North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, comes at a time when growth in most of the region's economies has been slowing after a decade of sustained growth. Further stagnation is likely in the absence of improvements in the core conditions for competitiveness. Compounding the challenge to Africa's leaders is a rapidly expanding population.},

  abstract = {"The epic story of the rise and fall of the empire of cotton, its centrality in the world economy, and its making and remaking of global capitalism. Sven Beckert's rich, fascinating book tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world's most significant manufacturing industry combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in 1780, these men created a potent innovation (Beckert calls it war capitalism, capitalism based on unrestrained actions of private individuals; the domination of masters over slaves, of colonial capitalists over indigenous inhabitants), and crucially affected the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia. We see how this thing called war capitalism shaped the rise of cotton, and then was used as a lever to transform the world. The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, farmers and merchants, workers and factory owners. In this as in so many other ways, Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the modern world. The result is a book as unsettling and disturbing as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist"--R\'esum\'e de l'\'editeur.},

  abstract = {During the nineteenth century, the United States entered the ranks of the world's most advanced and dynamic economies. At the same time, the nation sustained an expansive and brutal system of human bondage. This was no mere coincidence. Slavery's Capitalism argues for slavery's centrality to the emergence of American capitalism in the decades between the Revolution and the Civil War. According to editors Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman, the issue is not whether slavery itself was or was not capitalist but, rather, the impossibility of understanding the nation's spectacular pattern of economic development without situating slavery front and center. American capitalism\textemdash renowned for its celebration of market competition, private property, and the self-made man\textemdash has its origins in an American slavery predicated on the abhorrent notion that human beings could be legally owned and compelled to work under force of violence.Drawing on the expertise of sixteen scholars who are at the forefront of rewriting the history of American economic development, Slavery's Capitalism identifies slavery as the primary force driving key innovations in entrepreneurship, finance, accounting, management, and political economy that are too often attributed to the so-called free market. Approaching the study of slavery as the originating catalyst for the Industrial Revolution and modern capitalism casts new light on American credit markets, practices of offshore investment, and understandings of human capital. Rather than seeing slavery as outside the institutional structures of capitalism, the essayists recover slavery's importance to the American economic past and prompt enduring questions about the relationship of market freedom to human freedom.Contributors: Edward E.

The infinite book limit is, as a consequence, proposed to be given by {$\gamma$}=1 instead of the value {$\gamma$}=2 expected if Zipf's law is universally applicable. In addition, we explore the idea that the systematic text-length dependence can be described by a meta book concept, which is an abstract representation reflecting the word-frequency structure of a text.

  abstract = {Hosted out of the University of Virginia, Digital Yoknapatawpha is an international collaboration between scholars of William Faulkner and technologists at the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities. The project team has encoded all the locations, characters, and events in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha fictions into a relational database that powers an open-access web-portal. Users can avail of an atlas of ``deep-maps,'' data visualizations, archival material, and aural and visual resources to explore, teach, and research his works. Using techniques common in ecology and demography, this paper leverages the data to investigate the relationship between race, kinship, and space. It concludes, tentatively, that the social world of Yoknapatawpha is far more rigidly bounded along racial lines than current scholarship suggests. In particular, most interactions between characters from different races happen in a familial context, and are the result of racialized labor exploitation or outright enslavement of African-American families by Anglo-Americans. The lack of interactions outside of this context underscores just how little agency non-white characters have in Faulkner's fiction.},

We find that, as prescribed by Heaps' Law, vocabulary sizes and text lengths follow a well-defined power-law relation. Meanwhile, the appearance of new words in each text does not obey a power law, and is on the whole well described by the average of random shufflings of the text. Deviations from this average, however, are statistically significant and show systematic trends across the corpus. Specifically, we find that the appearance of new words along each text is predominantly retarded with respect to the average of random shufflings. Moreover, different tags add systematically distinct contributions to this tendency, with verbs and others being respectively more and less retarded than the mean trend, and nouns following instead the overall mean. These statistical systematicities are likely to point to the existence of linguistically relevant information stored in the different variants of Heaps' Law, a feature that is still in need of extensive assessment.},

  abstract = {In this powerful, compassionate work, one of anthropology's most distinguished ethnographers weaves together rich fieldwork with a compelling critical analysis in a book that will surely make a signal contribution to contemporary thinking about violence and how it affects everyday life. Veena Das examines case studies including the extreme violence of the Partition of India in 1947 and the massacre of Sikhs in 1984 after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In a major departure from much anthropological inquiry, Das asks how this violence has entered "the recesses of the ordinary" instead of viewing it as an interruption of life to which we simply bear witness. Das engages with anthropological work on collective violence, rumor, sectarian conflict, new kinship, and state and bureaucracy as she embarks on a wide-ranging exploration of the relations among violence, gender, and subjectivity. Weaving anthropological and philosophical reflections on the ordinary into her analysis, Das points toward a new way of interpreting violence in societies and cultures around the globe. The book will be indispensable reading across disciplinary boundaries as we strive to better understand violence, especially as it is perpetrated against women.},

In this collection Fred Hobson has brought together eight of the most stimulating essays on Absalom, essays written over a thirty-year span which approach the novel both formally and historically. Here are critical responses by Cleanth Brooks, John Irwin, Thadious Davis, and Eric Sundquist, as well as four essays published in the last decade. The casebook concludes with Faulkner's own remarks on the novel, delivered in a discussion with students at the University of Virginia. What emerges from all the selections is a rich and suggestive treatment of a work which Faulkner himself called "the best novel yet written by an American" and a less biased critic has called "the greatest American novel of the century... joining Moby-Dick and Huckleberry Finn at the pinnacle of American fiction."},

Only by a closer examination of the language of the text may we understand how the thematic questions about the illusive nature of history and the truth of storytelling are woven into the text. Such attention to the language and to the interplay of different narrative types shows how the text itself compels us to read it as history while at the same time constantly bringing to the foreground the speculative nature of the endeavor.},

Proust accomplishes his documented intent to have Jews as one of the thematic constants in his work by inserting Jewish characters (particularly the dominant one, Swann) and by using the Dreyfus Affair and antisemitism as literary tools for peering into high society. His essential Jewishness as a person is unresolved and adherence to any religious faith is questionable. The Dreyfus Affair and his Jewish heritage, however, were indispensable to his genius.}

Building on organizational ecology, it may be argued that the immigrant group acts as an economic niche for small business. Large groups provide a more favorable niche for ethnic entrepreneurs than small groups, because large groups provide large specialized ethnic markets. Groups whose members are not fluent in the dominant language provide more favorable niches for immigrant entrepreneurs, because they provide a linguistically isolated labor pool whose skills can be more efficiently tapped by coethnic rather than majority group entrepreneurs. Because of its large and heterogeneous immigrant population, Australia is a particularly appropriate site for testing these hypotheses. With a one-percent Public Use Sample of the 1981 Australian Census, a multilevel logistic regression model predicts individuals' probabilities of business ownership as a function of the size of the group (ethnic market size), the percent of the group who speak English badly (the linguistically isolated labor pool), and the individual's own language skills and human capital characteristics. The results support both hypotheses.}

He examines Spengler's relationship to German historicism, his place in the German traditions of cultural pessimism and Realpolitik, and his critical stance toward Nazism."--BOOK JACKET.},

Much previous scholarship and public discussion has focused on comparing European ideas about Jews and Judaism in the past with contemporary attitudes towards Muslims and Islam. This volume rejects this approach. Instead, it interrogates how the dynamic relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia has evolved over time and space. The result is the uncovering of a previously unknown story in which European ideas about Jews and Muslims were indeed connected, but were also ripped apart. Religion, empire, nation-building, and war, all played their part in the complex evolution of this relationship. As well as a study of prejudice, this book also opens up a new area of inquiry: how Muslims, Jews, and others have responded to these historically connected racisms. The volume brings together leading scholars in the emerging field of antisemitism-Islamophobia studies who work in a diverse range of disciplines: anthropology, history, sociology, critical theory, and literature. Together, they help us to understand a Europe in which Jews and Arabs were once called Semites, and today are widely thought to be on two different sides of the War on Terror},

  abstract = {The Ca2(+)- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase-C (PK-C), was studied in fetal rat liver between d 17 and 21 of gestation. Initial studies showed that rat liver, membrane-associated PK-C could be detected as a protein of Mr = 80,000 using a polyclonal rat brain PK-C antiserum. Fetal hepatic membrane-bound PK-C activity rose as gestation progressed with adult levels (21 +/- 3 pmol/min/mg protein) being attained by term. Although fasting for 48 h led to PK-C activation in adult livers, fetal hepatic PK-C was not activated by 48 h of maternal fasting. Membrane-associated protein phosphatase activity that might reverse PK-C action was also studied. PK-C sites in casein (an artificial PK-C substrate) were selectively dephosphorylated by a membrane-associated, poly-cation-stimulated protein phosphatase. This activity, thus classified as protein phosphatase type-2A, was constitutively expressed in fetal liver membranes from 17-21 d gestation. We have previously reported that the other major hepatic protein phosphatase, protein phosphatase type-1, also is constitutively expressed during the later stage of gestation. Taken together with the results of our present study, our data indicate that PK-C-dependent phosphorylation in fetal liver probably increases with advancing gestation.},

It also does not hold for syllables or words in the syllable-based languages, Chinese or Vietnamese. However, when single words are combined together with word n-grams in one list and put in rank order, the frequency of tokens in the combined list extends Zipf's law with a slope close to -1 on a log-log plot in all five languages. Further experiments have demonstrated the validity of this extension of Zipf's law to n-grams of letters, phonemes or binary bits in English. It is shown theoretically that probability theory alone can predict this behavior in randomly created n-grams of binary bits.},

Katharina von Kellenbach draws on letters exchanged between clergy and Nazi perpetrators, written notes of prison chaplains, memoirs, sermons, and prison publications to illuminate the moral and spiritual struggles of perpetrators after the war. These documents provide intimate insights into the self-reflection and self-perception of perpetrators. As Germany looks back on more than sixty years of passionate debate about political, personal and legal guilt, its ongoing engagement with the legacy of perpetration has transformed its culture and politics. In many post-genocidal societies, it falls to clergy and religious officials (in addition to the courts) to negotiate and create a path for individuals beyond the atrocities of the past. German clergy brought the Christian message of guilt and forgiveness into the internment camps where Nazi functionaries awaited prosecution at the hands of Allied military tribunals and various national criminal courts, or served out their sentences. The loving willingness to forgive and forget displayed towards his errant child by the father in the parable of the Prodigal Son became the paradigm central to Germany's rehabilitation and reintegration of Nazi perpetrators. The problem with Luke's parable in this context, however, is that perpetrators did not ask for forgiveness. Most agents of state crimes felt innocent. Von Kellenbach proposes the story of the mark of Cain as a counter narrative. In contrast to the Prodigal Son, who is quickly forgiven and welcomed back into the house of the father, the fratricide Cain is charged to rebuild his life on the basis of open communication about the past.

In this book, Neil Levi explores how the antisemitic fantasy of a mobile, dangerous, contagious Jewish spirit unfolds in the antimodernist polemics of Richard Wagner, Max Nordau, Wyndham Lewis, and Louis-Ferdinand Celine, reaching its apotheosis in the notorious 1937 Nazi exhibition "Degenerate Art." Levi then turns to James Joyce, Theodor W. Adorno, and Samuel Beckett, offering radical new interpretations of these modernist authors to show how each presents his own poetics as a self-conscious departure from the modern antisemitic imaginary. Levi claims that, just as antisemites once feared their own contamination by a mobile, polluting Jewish spirit, so too much of postwar thought remains governed by the fear that it might be contaminated by the spirit of antisemitism.

In this book, Neil Levi explores how the antisemitic fantasy of a mobile, dangerous, contagious Jewish spirit unfolds in the antimodernist polemics of Richard Wagner, Max Nordau, Wyndham Lewis, and Louis-Ferdinand Celine, reaching its apotheosis in the notorious 1937 Nazi exhibition "Degenerate Art." Levi then turns to James Joyce, Theodor W. Adorno, and Samuel Beckett, offering radical new interpretations of these modernist authors to show how each presents his own poetics as a self-conscious departure from the modern antisemitic imaginary. Levi claims that, just as antisemites once feared their own contamination by a mobile, polluting Jewish spirit, so too much of postwar thought remains governed by the fear that it might be contaminated by the spirit of antisemitism. Thus he argues for the need to confront and work through our own fantasies and projections not only about the figure of the Jew but also about that of the antisemite"-- "This book argues that the antisemitic interpretation of modernist form as a symptom of a mobile, contagious Jewish spirit needs to be treated as integral to the history of European modernism. The notion of modernist form as Jewified lies at the heart of both a certain modernism's hostile reception, and its self-conception"--},

The distinction among the four narrative perspectives in "Absalom," "Absalom!," however, is not stylistic, but formal. Faulkner differentiates the viewpoints in the novel by shaping each perspective after a different literary genre. It is a skillful adaptation of form to meaning, for the selection of these particular genres expresses, structurally, the imagination's subjective act of re-creating history, engaged in by four narrators emotionally involved in either Thomas Sutpen or the Southern myth: Rosa Coldfield, haunted by the moral "outrage" inflicted by the "demonic" Sutpen, shapes her narrative to the Gothic mystery; Mr. Compson, convinced of the epical proportions of the South, relates his narrative as a Greek tragedy; Quentin, obsessed by Henry's relationship with Judith because of his own involvement with Caddy, presented in "The Sound and the Fury," expresses his narrative in the framework of the chivalric romance; and Shreve, the detached, intellectual Northerner, relieves the intensity of the preceding viewpoints by means of the ludicrous humor of the tall tale.}

Despite changes in demography, the meaning of citizenship, and the ability to treat and cure acute and chronic diseases, foreigners were consistently associated with germs and contagion. This article explores why, at critical junctures in American history, immigrants have been stigmatized as the etiology of a variety of physical and societal ills. The article analyzes three periods from 1880 to the present and suggests that now, as germs progressively and, often, indiscriminately cross national, social, and economic boundaries through multiple vectors, the mistakes of the past must not be repeated. Protecting the public health in the current era of globalization requires an ecumenical, pragmatic, and historically informed approach to understanding the links between immigration and disease.}

For Musil the structural affinity shared by the political and the aesthetic is grounded in the way each facilitates an agonistic exchange between dissenting perspectives. This clash of perspectives is what averts the threat of totalitarianism, which Musil identifies with the imposition of a totalizing, absolute vision upon the disparate life spheres that characterize the modern world. This forced integration was fatefully realized in Musil's day by the strategy of Gleichschaltung pursued by the Nazi regime.

  abstract = {Las Meninas (pronounced [las me{$\Elzverts$}ninas]; Spanish for The Ladies-in-waiting) is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Vel\'azquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. The painting shows a large room in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid during the reign of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Vel\'azquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Vel\'azquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Vel\'azquez is shown working on. Las Meninas has long been recognised as one of the most important paintings in Western art history. The Baroque painter Luca Giordano said that it represents the "theology of painting" and in 1827 the president of the Royal Academy of Arts Sir Thomas Lawrence described the work in a letter to his successor David Wilkie as "the true philosophy of the art". More recently, it has been described as "Vel\'azquez's supreme achievement, a highly self-conscious, calculated demonstration of what painting could achieve, and perhaps the most searching comment ever made on the possibilities of the easel painting".},

This finally resulted in passively gobbling the tales of the mystification. With this research, we try to bring to light the still dark aspects of the "PSM'"s origins (they were edited five times in Russia in the years 1905-1906), and this, not with the help of the numerous contradictory leaflets which appeared along with their publication, but with the help of the only element which cannot be disguised and cannot lie: the text itself, with its typological conformation and the forms of its tradition.}

  publisher = {{Univ. Press of Mississippi}},
  abstract = {As a chronicler of the African American experience in fiction and as an incisive cultural commentator in her essays and lectures, Toni Morrison (b. 1931) is regarded as one of the nation's most distinguished novelists and intellectuals. Her novels are richly layered narratives that explore the meanings of tragedy and myth in individual lives. Morrison's perspectives on American life and culture, rendered with a deep understanding of the consequences of history and the power of art, are always compelling. Toni Morrison: Conversations includes interviews with the Nobel Laureate that bring into the foreground Morrison's comments on American literature and society, the academy, and her own work. She discusses growing up in Lorain, Ohio, her role as editor at Random House, the continuing evolution of her style, her teaching philosophy, and her most recent novels Jazz, Paradise, and Love. This volume includes interviews and profiles from the 1970s and 1980s that were not collected in Conversations with Toni Morrison (1993) and a rich collection of new interviews published together for the first time, including conversations with Paula Giddings, Salman Rushdie, Charlie Rose, and Elissa Schappell. Carolyn C. Denard is the author of scholarly essays on Toni Morrison and the forthcoming Cambridge Introduction to Toni Morrison. She is Associate Dean of the College at Brown University and founder of the Toni Morrison Society.},

  author = {Nobles, Melissa},
  year = {2000},
  publisher = {{Stanford University Press}},
  abstract = {This book explores the politics of race, censuses, and citizenship, drawing on the complex history of questions about race in the U.S. and Brazilian censuses. It reconstructs the history of racial categorization in American and Brazilian censuses from each countrys first census in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries up through the 2000 census. It sharply challenges certain presumptions that guide scholarly and popular studies, notably that census bureaus are (or are designed to be) innocent bystanders in the arena of politics, and that racial data are innocuous demographic data.  Using previously overlooked historical sources, the book demonstrates that counting by race has always been a fundamentally political process, shaping in important ways the experiences and meanings of citizenship. This counting has also helped to create and to further ideas about race itself. The author argues that far from being mere producers of racial statistics, American and Brazilian censuses have been the ultimate insiders with respect to racial politics.  For most of their histories, American and Brazilian censuses were tightly controlled by state officials, social scientists, and politicians. Over the past thirty years in the United States and the past twenty years in Brazil, however, certain groups within civil society have organized and lobbied to alter the methods of racial categorization. This book analyzes both the attempt of Americas multiracial movement to have a multiracial category added to the U.S. census and the attempt by Brazils black movement to include racial terminology in census forms. Because of these efforts, census bureau officials in the United States and Brazil today work within political and institutional constraints unknown to their predecessors. Categorization has become as much a \&quot;bottom-up process as a \&quot;top-down one.},

  abstract = {Absalom, Absalom! treats on individual and social levels the passage from a world of dream to a world of limits. Four aspects of this theme are related to types of parentheses which recur in the novel. The problem of the self and external world is embodied in the interpretative digression, the parenthesis which reveals Quentin Compson's unspoken imaginings, and the interruption by the external world in the person of Shreve. The problem of communication is adumbrated by the many explanatory parentheses, including the parenthesized noun in apposition with a preceding pronoun. The problem of history is revealed not only in the allusion to another level of time, but also in the parenthesis which casts doubt on the matter outside the parenthesis. The difficulty of encompassing reality within a single concept or mind is dramatized by parentheses of confrontation and tension. The distribution of parentheses throughout the novel reveals a peculiar importance to the middle chapter, and this uniqueness is explained as centering the novel on Quentin's point of contact with the world of limits.},

This book explores how Scott's work became an all-pervasive point of reference for cultural memory and collective identity in the nineteenth century, and why it no longer has this role. Ann Rigney breaks new ground in memory studies and the study of literary reception by examining the dynamics of cultural memory and the 'social life' of literary texts across several generations and multiple media. She pays attention to the remediation of the Waverley novels as they travelled into painting, the theatre, and material culture, as well as to the role of 'Scott' as a memory site in the public sphere for a century after his death. Using a wide range of examples and supported by many illustrations, Rigney demonstrates how remembering Scott's work helped shape national and transnational identities up to World War One, and contributed to the emergence of the idea of an English-speaking world encompassing Scotland, the British Empire and the United States. Scott's work provided an imaginative resource for creating a collective relation to the past that was compatible with widespread mobility and social change; and that he thus forged a potent alliance between memory, literature, and identity that was eminently suited to modernizing. In the process he helped prepare his own obsolescence but his legacy continues in the widespread belief that showcasing the past is a condition for transcending it."\textendash Publisher's website.},

Calvin Schermerhorn charts changes in the family lives of enslaved Americans, exploring the broader processes of nation-building in the United States, growth and intensification of national and international markets, the institutionalization of chattel slavery, and the growing relevance of race in the politics and society of the republic. In chapters organized chronologically, Schermerhorn argues that American economic development relied upon African Americans' social reproduction while simultaneously destroying their intergenerational cultural continuity. He explores the personal narratives of enslaved people and develops themes such as politics, economics, labor, literature, rebellion, and social conditions.},

Worried about a possible scandal, he considerably self-censored his text as "Le Temps retrouv\'e" was approaching publication. He defined a number of narrative strategies (character-focalization, meta-diegetic narration, conflicting discourses) that allowed him to distance himself from his criticism and thus to express his opinions in a more oblique and ironic way.}

  abstract = {Originally published in 1986. William Faulkner's major novels represent one of the earliest American explorations into the paradoxes inherent in both literary discourse and racial segregation in the American South. Figures of Division demonstrates that these works reject conventional divisions and a social and linguistic deception, and discover a reality where people merge across social boundaries. This analysis of Faulkner's narrative discourse shows for the first time that the mechanisms of social division profoundly affect both the content and the form of his major novels.},

  abstract = {Absalom, Absalom! has long been seen as one of William Faulkner's supreme creations, as well as one of the leading American novels of the twentieth century. In this collection Fred Hobson has brought together eight of the most stimulating essays on Absalom, essays written over a thirty-year span which approach the novel both formally and historically. Here are critical responses by Cleanth Brooks, John Irwin, Thadious Davis, and Eric Sundquist, as well as four essays published in the last decade. The casebook concludes with Faulkner's own remarks on the novel, delivered in a discussion with students at the University of Virginia. What emerges from all the selections is a rich and suggestive treatment of a work which Faulkner himself called "the best novel yet written by an American" and a less biased critic has called "the greatest American novel of the century... joining Moby-Dick and Huckleberry Finn at the pinnacle of American fiction."},
